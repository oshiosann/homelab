% Password expiration warning.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Cisco Configuration Professional (Cisco CP) is installed on this device
and it provides the default username "cisco" for  one-time use. If you have 
already used the username "cisco" to login to the router and your IOS image 
supports the "one-time" user option, then this username has already expired. 
You will not be able to login to the router with this username after you exit 
this session.
 
It is strongly suggested that you create a new username with a privilege level 
of 15 using the following command.
 
username <myuser> privilege 15 secret 0 <mypassword>
 
Replace <myuser> and <mypassword> with the username and password you 
want to use.

Cisco Configuration Professional (Cisco CP) is installed on this device.
This feature requires the one-time use of the username "cisco" with the 
password "cisco". These default credentials have a privilege level of 15.
 
YOU MUST USE CISCO CP or the CISCO IOS CLI TO CHANGE THESE
PUBLICLY-KNOWN CREDENTIALS

Here are the Cisco IOS commands.

username <myuser>  privilege 15 secret 0 <mypassword>
no username cisco

Replace <myuser> and <mypassword> with the username and password you want 
to use. 

IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE THE PUBLICLY-KNOWN CREDENTIALS, YOU WILL 
NOT BE ABLE TO LOG INTO THE DEVICE AGAIN AFTER YOU HAVE LOGGED OFF.
 
For more information about Cisco CP please follow the instructions in the
QUICK START GUIDE for your router or go to http://www.cisco.com/go/ciscocp
