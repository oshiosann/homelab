■Work Procedure
  1.Create base VM
    Read Document "instruction_create_vm"

    Before move next step, boot VM by running commands below

    # virsh list --all
    =>Check the VM is not running
             Id   Name           State
      -------------------------------
       44   dev-bacu001v   shut off
    # virsh start <VM name>
    # virsh list --all
    =>Check if the status of VM was changed
       Id   Name           State
      -------------------------------
       44   dev-bacu001v   running

  2.Basic settings
    2-1.Disable Wi-Fi function
        # nmcli radio wifi
        =>Check current settings
        # nmcli radio wifi off
        # nmcli radio wifi
        # nmcli c s
        =>Check that the settings have been applied

    2-2.Disable IPv6
        # nmcli con mod "<name>" ipv6.method disabled
        # nmcli c down "<name>" && nmcli con up "<name>"
        # ip a |grep inet6
        # ip a
        =>Check that the settings have been applied
          Ipv6 address of <name> Network interface should be disappeard
        # cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<name>/disable_ipv6
        =>Check if the value is "1"

    2-3.Basic Firewall settings
        # systemctl status firewalld
        =>Check if "Active status" is "inactive (dead)"
        # systemctl start firewalld
        =>Execute this command If "Active status" is "inactive (dead)"
        # firewall-cmd --list-all
        =>Check if the content is the same as below
          public (active)
            target: default
            icmp-block-inversion: no
            interfaces: <name>
            sources:
            services: cockpit dhcpv6-client ssh
            ports:
            protocols:
            forward: yes
            masquerade: no
            forward-ports:
            source-ports:
            icmp-blocks:
            rich rules:
        # systemctl enable firewalld
        # systemctl is-enabled firewalld
        =>Check if it is "enabled"

        These tasks are for stopping and disabling firewalld.(Skip them)
        # systemctl status firewalld
        =>Check if "Active status" is "active (running)"
        # systemctl --now disable firewalld
        # systemctl status firewalld
        =>Check that the status changed "Active: inactive (dead)"

    2-4.ssh settings
        # cp -p /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config_org
        # ls -l /etc/ssh/sshd_config*
        # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        =>Modify conf file like below
          #PermitRootLogin no
          =>Modify prohibit-password to no
        # systemctl restart sshd && sudo systemctl enable sshd
        # systemctl status sshd
        # systemctl is-enabled sshd
        =>Check if there are any errors, enabled sshd and the Active status is "active (running)"
          Do login test

    2-5.NTP settings
        # systemctl status chronyd
        # cp -p  /etc/chrony.conf /etc/chrony.conf_org
        # ls -l /etc/chrony.conf*
        # vi /etc/chrony.conf
        =>Modify conf file like below
          pool 192.168.10.4 iburst
        # systemctl restart chronyd && systemctl enable chronyd
        # systemctl status chronyd
        =>Check if there are any errors and enabled
        # chronyc sources
        =>Check if chrony syncs with specified IP address and the status changed "Active: active (running)"
